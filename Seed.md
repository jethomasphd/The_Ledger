# Seed: The Ledger

## The Matter

The Ledger is an educational, anti-flood interface for U.S. federal primary sources: **bills, bill text versions, actions, and roll call votes**. It is built to make a regular citizen *procedurally literate* and capable of reading power directly from the public record—without needing a pundit, a party, or an institution to translate reality for them.

This is not “fact checking.” Fact checking can become more flood. The Ledger is a **guided interaction container**: the user asks a question, the system proposes multiple retrieval strategies, the user curates the corpus, and the AI reads only what the user selected—producing outputs that are always tethered to primary-source receipts.

The core outcome: **citizen agency** through **primary-source contact** with **ease**.

## The Architecture

### Primary-source first, receipts always

The Ledger is built around a strict provenance chain:

* **Search & metadata**: Congress.gov API (via api.data.gov)
* **Canonical bill text + bill status packages**: govinfo API (via api.data.gov)
* **House roll call records**: Office of the Clerk (House)
* **Senate roll call records**: U.S. Senate LIS / Senate roll call lists

Every claim generated by the system must be anchored to a “receipt token” that links directly to a primary record (bill, section, action, or vote).

### Turned Tables interaction pattern (replicated)

The Ledger inherits the Turned Tables doctrine:

1. User asks in plain English
2. System generates **multiple retrieval strategies** (transparent)
3. User **selects** bills / documents (curation step)
4. AI reads only the selected matter
5. System outputs a brief with receipts + provenance log + exports

### Non-flood interface primitives

* **Missions, not feeds**: each bill becomes a short, bounded learning encounter.
* **3–3–3 default**: show 3 sections + 3 key actions + 3 key votes; expand only on demand.
* **Split view reader**: primary source on the left, guided interpretation on the right.
* **Procedural classifier**: votes are labeled (procedural vs substantive) with “camouflage” callouts.

### Receipt token schema (core primitive)

All generated text must cite one or more tokens:

* BILL: `BILL:{congress}-{chamber}{number}` (e.g., `BILL:118-HR1234`)
* TEXT: `TEXT:{source}:{package_or_granule_id}`
* SECTION: `SEC:{bill_id}:{section_path}` (e.g., `SEC:118-HR1234:201(a)(3)`)
* ACTION: `ACT:{bill_id}:{yyyy-mm-dd}:{action_id}`
* HOUSE VOTE: `VOTE:HOUSE:{congress}:RC-{rollcall}`
* SENATE VOTE: `VOTE:SENATE:{congress}:RC-{rollcall}`

Receipts are clickable and resolve to the underlying primary record.

## The Decisions

### Educational, not flood

* The Ledger does not “tell you what to think.” It teaches you how to read the record.
* AI is a translator and guide, not an authority. The user is always one click from the source.

### Scarcity as a feature

* Default outputs are intentionally small (3–3–3). This is an anti-flood constraint.
* The user must opt into expansion. The interface is built to resist doomscrolling.

### User-curated corpus

* The system proposes; the user selects. AI reads only what the user chose.
* This prevents the “AI as omniscient narrator” failure mode and strengthens trust.

### Procedural literacy as the highest leverage

* The most important civic skill is understanding procedural camouflage.
* Ledger will explicitly label procedural votes and teach what they mean at the moment they appear.

### Privacy posture (Turned Tables lineage)

* No server-side keys. Keys remain in the browser.
* Minimal/no analytics. Exportable artifacts. Reproducible results.

## The Open Questions

* **Scope v1**: start with current Congress only, or support historical congresses from day one?
* **Vote linkage strategy**: rely on Congress.gov linkages where available vs independently mapping votes to bills via external identifiers and vote descriptions.
* **Bill text version diff**: implement full structured diffs now, or ship “changes since last version” as AI-assisted summaries with explicit version citations?
* **Document parsing**: do we extract structured sections from XML first, or launch with PDF/HTML viewing + minimal structure?
* **Procedural vote taxonomy**: define the initial set of vote classes and rules (cloture, rule votes, motion to recommit, suspension, etc.).
* **Search UX**: keyword-only, or allow advanced filters (sponsor, committee, subject, date range) in v1?
* **Caching**: what can be cached locally without violating the “no flood” constraint or confusing provenance?

## The Standards

### Quality

* No hallucinations: every claim requires at least one receipt token.
* Explicit labeling:

  * **WITNESSED** (directly supported by cited text/vote)
  * **INFERENCE** (reasoned from record but not explicit)
  * **UNWITNESSED** is disallowed in the final brief.

### UX / Aesthetic

* Calm, sparse, readable.
* Primary sources are always visible and one click away.
* The interface should feel like a guided archive, not a social feed.

### Functional requirements

* Search → shortlist → curate → read → brief export must work end-to-end.
* Exports:

  * `.md` brief with receipts
  * `.docx` brief
  * `.json` provenance log (strategies used, selected items, citations)
* All prompts used for retrieval/synthesis should be viewable.

### Anti-flood constraints

* No infinite scroll.
* No “trending.”
* No algorithmic feed.
* Default to bounded encounters (“missions”).

## The Lineage

The Ledger inherits from **Turned Tables**: an educational container that guides citizens through search and synthesis using AI, with transparency and user control.

* Reference implementation: `https://turned-tables.pages.dev/`
* Core doctrine inherited:

  * transparency of prompts/strategies
  * user-curated corpus
  * minimal cognitive load
  * exportable artifacts
  * keys stay client-side (privacy-first)

The Ledger adapts this lineage to federal legislative primary sources: **bills and votes**, with an emphasis on **procedural literacy** and **receipt-based trust**.
